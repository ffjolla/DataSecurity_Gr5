Implementation of a Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) on a Client-Server Model
Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is a mechanism for verifying the integrity and authenticity of a message transmitted between two parties. It involves a cryptographic hash function (such as SHA-256) and a secret key known only to the sender and the receiver.

Here's how HMAC works in a client-server model:
 Both the client and the server agree on a secret key beforehand. This key is kept confidential and is known only to them.
 When the client wants to send a message to the server, it creates the message and appends an HMAC to it. The HMAC is generated by hashing the message along with the secret key using a cryptographic hash function.
 The client sends the message along with the HMAC to the server.
 Upon receiving the message, the server extracts the HMAC and computes its own HMAC using the received message and the secret key. If the computed HMAC matches the received HMAC, it means that the message has not been altered in transit and that it was indeed sent by someone with knowledge of the secret key.
 After verifying the message, the server can respond to the client accordingly.
 In case the HMAC verification fails on the server side, indicating possible message tampering or unauthorized access, the server needs to handle this situation appropriately. It may choose to log the event, notify relevant parties, or reject the message altogether.
 Proper management of the secret key is crucial for the security of HMAC. Both the client and the server must securely store and handle the secret key to prevent unauthorized access. Key rotation, where keys are periodically changed, can also enhance security.
 While HMAC provides integrity and authenticity assurances, it's essential to consider other security aspects such as encryption for confidentiality and secure communication protocols (like TLS/SSL) to protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Steps to execute Server<br>

 - Write the server code in a file, for example, server.py.<br>
 - Save the file with the server code.<br>
 - Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.<br>
 - Open a terminal or command line.<br>
 - Navigate to the directory where the server.py file is located using the cd command.<br>
 - Once you're in the correct directory, type the command python server.py and press Enter.<br>
 - The server will start and wait for incoming messages.<br>
 - Leave the terminal open to keep the server running. You can stop the server by pressing Ctrl+C.<br>

Steps to execute Client<br>
 - Write the client code in a file and save it as client.py.<br>
 - Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.<br>
 - Open the terminal or command line on your operating system.<br>
 - Navigate to the directory where the client.py file is saved using the cd command.<br>
 - Once you're in the correct directory, type the command python client.py and press Enter.<br>
 - The client will prompt you to input a message to send to the server. Enter your message and press Enter.<br>
 - Wait for the server response, which will be displayed in the terminal after the message verification.<br>
